## Homework 5
This assignment was designed in order for us to get comfortable with ASP.NET MVC 5, HTTP GET, and HTTP POST by creating two simple webpages requiring user input. We did this in two different ways -- via query strings and passing information via GET/POST parameters.

### Step 1 [Setup]
I created a empty MVC project called 'assignment5' and got started changing the home/index page and the styling. Since it's Spooktober (aka October/Halloween time), I wanted to keep my "spooky" aesthetic going in my demos--thus I decided to use Silent Hill as a basic inspiration for the page by calling the apartment complex 'Silent Hills' and used an image from the series as the background for the demo website. The .css file was giving me issues and I could never figure out how to fix it, so all the styling is coded in the html of the layout page.
