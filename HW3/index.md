## Homework 3
This assignment was designed in order for us to get comfortable with writing in C# -- the different naming conventions, interfaction implementation, exception handling, and more. We were given a simple Java program that prints out all the binary representations of a number from 1 to n and we converted that into C# using the Visual Studio IDE.

### Step 1 & 2 [Setup]
First we downloaded and set up the Visual Studio IDE (Community 2017) and installed the necessary modifiers for programming in C#. This was a simple process, beyond taking over an hour to install each on my Surface and on my home PC. I then downloaded the Java files, compiled, and test the program. Then I set up my .gitignore file to exclude everything but the .cs files in my HW3 subfolders.

### Step 3 & 4 [Planning & Design, Content/Coding]
After Visual Studio IDE was finished installing, I started a new console app project and had my blank .cs files and their corresponding Java files open with a split screen so I could look at the Java files while I wrote my C# versions. I also started a new branch on my git called "hw3" from the beginning (with my .gitignore file and testing that before converting the code) and used that branch for the entire project.
