## Homework 1  
The goal of this assignment was to get familiar with git, HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS. To do, we
installed and got familiar with various programs and basic web design building by making
a simple webpage to showcase these skills. Through this assignment, I have learned the basics 
of HTML and CSS. 

### Step 1 [Setup]  
I already had a GitHub account set up from my summer internship at University of Connecticut, but I had not worked with it via a bash or command line. I downloaded and installed Git, Bootstrap, and Visual Studio Code, and enabled the necessary plugins for Visual Studio for both this assignment and future assignments. I set up folders on both my Surface and my home PC so I can switch between working at home and working on campus. I will keep each assignment in it’s own folder separately within a main CS460 folder. 

First I added an empty README through GitHub's website, then created and organized all my folders via Visual Studio Code. While all my folder and file organization is done via
Visual, all updates to my repository are done from Git Bash. I set up the bash by following the tutorial from [Don't be Afraid to Commit](https://dont-be-afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/commandlinegit.html):

```
git config --global user.name “siphry”
git config --global user.email “stacia.i.fry@gmail.com”
```

To add my changes made through Visual, I follow this base cycle of commands in the bash:

```
git add . 
git status
git commit -m "commit message here"
git push origin [branch]
```
