### Homework 1  
The goal of this assignment was to get familiar with git, HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS. To do, we
installed and got familiar with various programs and basic web design building by making
a simple webpage to showcase these skills. Through this assignment, I have learned the basics 
of HTML and CSS. 

## Step 1 [Setup]  
I already had a GitHub account set up from my summer internship at University of Connecticut, but I had not worked with it via a bash or command line. I downloaded and installed Git and Visual Studio Code, and enabled the necessary plugins for Visual Studio for both this assignment and future assignments. I set up folders on both my Surface and my home PC so I can switch between working at home and working on campus. I will keep each assignment in itâ€™s own folder separately within a main CS460 folder.
