### About Me
Welcome to my senior sequence portfolio and repository for Western Oregon University. I am a senior level post-baccalaureate in computer science. I have two bachelor’s from Pacific University and a master’s from Portland State University as well. 

I hope to graduate this year upon completion of the senior sequence. I am currently looking into careers in data science or software engineering.
