## Homework 2
The goal of homework 2 was to get familiar with both Javascript and JQuery for building webpages with user input, as well as modifying existing elements of the webpage.
I am slowly getting more comfortable exploring different elements of webdesign as well as understanding and incorporating different capabilities such user input and action events via Javascript, JQuery, etc.

### Step 1 [Setup]
I created a new folder in the directory, and created the files for this assignment via git bash and the `touch` command. I forgot about working from a new branch until I was almost done with the assignment unfortunately, but created the branch "surface" (later renamed to "hw2) about halfway through the styling process of my webpage after I had worked out most of the actual Javascript elements.    

### Step 2 [Planning & Design]
INSERT PICTURE FROM NOTEBOOK HERE!!!! LIST OF NAMES, ETC
At first I had no idea what to do at all, but when talking with other students on Monday someone mentioned a name generator and I decided to make a Halloween themed name generator, since whatever I did I wanted to make Halloween themed since this assignment was started/completed in October. A name generator is a relatively simple but fun project to make. I started by brain storming all of the first and last name options as well as the titles. Originally I did not want to come up with 52 different options but once I started thinking about how to translate the user inputted name into my Halloween-themed names, I decided it would just be simpler to come up with 52 options and assign each option to a letter in the alphabet. I was going to make titles tied to birth month but thought it'd be more fun to choose those randomly instead. 

### Step 3 [Planning & Design]
INSERT PICTURE FROM NOTEBOOK HERE!!!! 
My original design was similar to the webpage I created for assignment 1, but while working on the design in visual studio code and seeing how the name generator/list looked, I decided to go with the end result seen in the demo. The only elements that I really kept from my original design were the colors and including halloween-themed images.
