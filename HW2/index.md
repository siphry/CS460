## Homework 2
The goal of homework 2 was to get familiar with both Javascript and JQuery for building webpages with user input, as well as modifying existing elements of the webpage.
I am slowly getting more comfortable exploring different elements of webdesign as well as understanding and incorporating different capabilities such user input and action events via Javascript, JQuery, etc.
