## Homework 4
This assignment was designed in order for us to get comfortable with writing in C# -- the different naming conventions, interfaction implementation, exception handling, and more. We were given a simple Java program that prints out all the binary representations of a number from 1 to n and we converted that into C# using the Visual Studio IDE.
