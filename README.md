Welcome to my senior sequence portfolio and repository for Western Oregon University. These were my senior level post-baccalaureate in computer science course homework assignments. I have two bachelor’s from Pacific University and a master’s from Portland State University as well.

I graduated from WOU in 2019 and am currently employed at HP, Inc in Corvallis, OR.
